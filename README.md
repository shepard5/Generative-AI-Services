1) Open ‘Cover Letter Generator.’

2) A file window will open, select resume of your choice. Must be PDF format

3) Enter the LinkedIn job URL – Make sure to copy the link following this screenshot. Sometimes won’t work if using the URL at the top of the browser.

4) Give it a few seconds then enter your name etc (only used for the header of the cover letter) - Once those details are entered the cover letter will appear in the same folder.

5) (Optional) Rename or move cover letters to a different folder after they’re made if you want them for later - otherwise when the script runs again it’ll be overwritten with whatever new cover letter you’re trying to make.

Note: This method is known to work for all LinkedIn job postings, other website formats haven't been tested, but based on theory alone may work for some. The cover letter provided is a draft and should be used as such.
